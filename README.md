# Global Indicators Data Analysis Dashboard

This repository contains an interactive **Tableau Dashboard** developed to analyze key global indicators such as life expectancy, energy usage, CO2 emissions, and mobile phone usage. The project leverages visualizations to provide insights into regional and country-level data trends from **2003 to 2009**, with manually calculated averages and added columns for deeper analysis.

## Project Overview

This project aims to present and analyze data related to:
1. **Average life expectancy for males** using a color-coded map.
2. **Regional energy usage and CO2 emissions** comparison.
3. **Mobile phone usage** for countries starting with the letter "B" from 2003 to 2009.

### Key Features
- **Map Visualization**:
  - A **map of average life expectancy for males** across different countries, represented on a **green to yellow scale**, where green indicates the lowest average and yellow the highest.
  
- **Energy and CO2 Emissions Visualization**:
  - A comparative graphic of **regional energy usage** alongside **CO2 emissions**, highlighting regions with the highest and lowest energy consumption and environmental impact.

- **Mobile Phone Usage**:
  - A detailed chart showing **total mobile phone usage** from 2003 to 2009 for countries starting with the letter "B". The chart displays data on an annual basis to identify trends in mobile phone adoption over time.

### Visualizations
1. **Map of Male Life Expectancy**:
   - Countries are color-coded based on average life expectancy for males. Green represents the lowest averages, while yellow represents the highest, providing a clear visual representation of global life expectancy variations.
   
2. **Regional Energy Usage and CO2 Emissions**:
   - A combination of visualizations compares the energy consumption and CO2 emissions across different regions, making it easy to identify high- and low-performing areas in terms of sustainability and environmental impact.

3. **Mobile Phone Usage for Countries Starting with "B"**:
   - A year-over-year analysis of mobile phone usage for countries starting with the letter "B" from 2003 to 2009, tracking adoption and growth patterns over time.

### Manual Calculations and Added Columns
- **Averages**: Calculated manually for life expectancy and other key metrics.
- **Additional Columns**: Created in Tableau to facilitate the analysis of mobile phone usage and energy consumption across specific timeframes and regions.

## Tools and Technologies
- **Tableau**: Used for data preparation, visualization, and dashboard creation.
- **Manual Calculations**: Averages and additional metrics were calculated manually within Tableau to ensure accuracy in the analysis.
- **Included Data Source**: The dataset used for this project was provided within Tableau, covering global indicators.
